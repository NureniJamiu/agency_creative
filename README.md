# Agency Creative Website Landing Page

Welcome to our agency website landing page project! This project was developed by NureniJamiu and Abiton as part of our Chingu Developer program.

## Technologies Used

We used the following technologies to build this project:

- React
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Netlify

## Project Description

Our landing page showcases a modern agency website with a focus on clean design and user experience. The website is fully responsive, meaning it works on a variety of devices and screen sizes.

One of the key features of our landing page is the toggle functionality for light and dark themes. Users can switch between the two themes with ease, making the website more accessible and user-friendly.

We used React to build the website's front-end, Vite for fast and efficient development, TailwindCSS for styling and layout, and Netlify to deploy the project. We also implemented various animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.
